// This class is responsible for serializing and deserializing user information for session management in Passport. The serializeUser method takes a user object and extracts specific properties (firstName, lastName, email) to store in the session, while the deserializeUser method retrieves the stored user information from the session and makes it available for use in subsequent requests.
